<p>Now let's hear a story from no other than me... <br>
Once upon a time a <b>traveler</b> decided to go on a long adventure. He wanted a really exciting journey with his most trusted companion - <b>his backback</b>! Little did he know that the <i>backback</i> he always took with him was <b>a demon in disguise</b>. But even though that demon's goal was to lure the traveler into a trap of some sort, the traveler always managed to avoid every trick the demon tried. <br>
The fact that his backback always was with him during the most dangerous times from which he managed to escape with no harm led him to believe that it was like a good luck charm. But the adventure he was going for was different this time. He was going to experie—— Oh, look at the time! Haha, it's time for me to go, thank you for listening. I hope you come again to listen to more exciting stories I have.
